What does red taste like?

What if you were merely a brain in a vat, creating memories for a computer?

If you acted on a cause, was it your choice? or destined?

When does boldness rival brashness?

If the chicken lays the egg, when does the crow caw?

When you look at a beach, are you looking at a million new universes?

Have you ever tried living through the eyes of the fly on the wall?

Who are you when you arent hungry?

When the bell rings, who will answer the gong?
